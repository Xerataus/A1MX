In Our Workplaces: We’ve developed creative workspaces that offer variety to support employees’ diverse workplace needs. We have also developed robust remote-access capabilities so our employees can get their work done where and when they need to.

Supportive/Collaborative Environment: We have a diverse, inclusive and highly engaged workplace. We are encouraged to be ourselves at work, and we are supported and respected by our peers and our leaders.

Performance Driven: We do impactful work and are consistently rewarded for doing the right thing for our clients and for our teams. Pay, incentives and performance are closely linked at Leighton Avant-Garde Haus
